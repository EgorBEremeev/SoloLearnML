A wiki is run using wiki software;0
otherwise known as a wiki engine.;1
A wiki engine is a type of content management system,;1
but it differs from most other such systems,including blog software;0
in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader,;0
and wikis have little inherent structure,;1
allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the users.;0
There are dozens of different wiki engines in use,;1
both standalone and part of other software, such as bug tracking systems.;0
